# Linear-and-Multiple-Regression

Using Linear Regression we fit the model by sepal-length(1st column) and predict sepal-width(2nd column).Also 
calculate the root mean square error in iris data set.


Using Multiple Regression we fit the model by sepal-length(1st column) and sepal-width(2nd column) and predict 
petal-length(3rd column).Also calculate the root mean square error in this case.
